# Background

Involvement in invasive bedside procedures is a requirement for Pediatric [PEDS], Pediatric Emergency Medicine [PEM], and Emergency Medicine [EM] trainees during Pediatric Emergency Department [PED] rotations.

# Objectives

Quantify the number of invasive bedside procedures trainees attempt.

# Methods

Retrospective chart review of providers performing lumbar puncture [LP] and skin abscess incision and drainage [I&D] at a tertiary PED between 2017-2019, excluding consultant procedures. We included all patients evaluated in our ED, and all ED providers during the study period. We only included trainees that completed either a 2- or 4-week rotation. As unsuccessful procedure attempts may not be captured by billing or structured data, we created a natural language processing [NLP] model to capture all attempts. We calculated prevalence with Bayesian credible intervals.

# Results

We identified 1,113 LP and 798 I&D attempts during the study period. There were 928 resident rotations through the ED; 552 (59%) were PEDS residents, 359 (39%) EM trainees, and 17 (1.8%) visiting residents, in addition to 18 PEM fellows working in the ED each year. 
 
An LP was attempted by a PEDS resident in 310 (28%) of the cases, an EM resident in 174 (16%), a PEM fellow 267 (24%) and PEM attending 256 (23%). 

Calculating resident LP attempts per rotations resulted in a range of 0-5, with a median of 0.33 [IQR 0-1]. During the study period, 199 residents (43%) did not perform an LP during, while 126 residents (27%) performed a range of 2-15 LPs. 

For PEM fellows the average was 5 LPs throughout the entire 3-year fellowship and for PEM attendings it translates to under 1 LP a year.
 
An I&D was attempted by a PEDS resident in 176 (22%) of the cases, an EM resident in 152 (19%), a PEM fellow in 176 (22%), and  a PEM attending 263 (33%). 

Calculating Residents I&Ds attempts per rotation resulted in a range of 0-3 with a median of 0 (IQR 0-0.75). During the study period, 281 residents (60%) did not perform an abscess I&D during their rotations, while 64 residents (14%) performed a range of 2-8 I&Ds. 

For PEM fellows it was an average of 9 I&Ds throughout the entire 3-year fellowship and for PEM attendings it translates to 1-2 I&D a year.

Patients seen by an attending with no trainee involvement were more likely to have the procedures done by an attending.
